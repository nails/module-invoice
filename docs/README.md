# Docs for `nailsapp/module-invoice`
> Documentation is a WIP.


The Invoice & Payments module provides Nails applications with the ability to raise invoices and take payment using a variety of payment gateways.

It has been designed to be very generic and simple to expand, so that integration with other modules or the app is easy and straightforward.
