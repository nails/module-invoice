# Invoices
> Documentation is a WIP.

Invoices are, simply put, a collection of line items which total a specific amount in a specific currency. They can also contain custom data which is passed to the [Payment Event Handler](/docs/payments.md) when payment is received.


## Line Items
Each line item defines the item being purchased, as well as information such as quantity and cost.
